# RePTaR_arduino

We conceptualized, created, and trialed a prototype of a remote passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader (RePTaR) for use in obtaining individual identity scans of brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on Gu√•han. We investigated if this setup could help remotely scan individuals in a laboratory setting with hopes of eventual use of RePTaR in the field to augment monitoring work being done in targeted study areas. Aadithya Prakash wrote this code to program the Arduino for use in these laboratory tests, details of which can be found at https://github.com/amburgey/RePTaRprototype.git.
