# RePTaR_arduino

We conceptualized, created, and trialed a prototype of a remote passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag reader (RePTaR) for use in obtaining individual identity scans of brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis) on GuÃ¥han. We investigated if this setup could help remotely scan individuals in a laboratory setting with hopes of eventual use of RePTaR in the field to augment monitoring work being done in targeted study areas. Aadithya Prakash wrote this code to program the Arduino Nano for use in these laboratory tests, details of which can be found at https://github.com/amburgey/RePTaRprototype.git.

# Table of Contents

docs - This folder contains the Arduino Nano datasheet, a helpful guide to programming in the Arduino IDE, and a datasheet for the off-the-shelf RFID reader from Priority 1 Design. The datasheet for the RFID reader also includes resources to create a custom circuit/PCB.

src - The folder contains the code that runs on the Arduino Nano. This code should be flashed onto the device prior to deployment in the field.

# Required Packages and Versions Used

# How to Use This Repository

Download the Arduino IDE (v2.1.0) for your respective Operating System (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Load the sketch with File -> Open (./src/reptar_code/reptar_code.ino). Before flashing your device, make sure that the Board is set to "Arduino Nano".

Refer below for the wired connections of RePTaR as well as a diagram of all major components of the device. Remember that you will need:
* [2 Priority 1 RFID Readers (RFIDRW-E-TTL)](https://www.priority1design.com.au/shopfront/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=10)
* [1 MicroSD Card Reader](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13743?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3tCyBhDBARIsAEY0XNn5O9o0Hlj8NBFchsrtCgu6F2ImwUAz-HG_uhyLiJOoTxUlFUqC_hEaAsgHEALw_wcB)
* 1 MicroSD card
* [1 Real Time Clock (we have used the PCF8523)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3295)
* Copper Wire to create antennas that will be soldered to A+ and A- on the RFID PCB.
